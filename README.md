# PacketPi
Is an ansible configuration that provisions linux AX25 tools on a Raspberry Pi.

Clone this repo and edit the variables in inventory/hosts.yml, update your callsign and netrom alias
Run the following commands on your Raspberry Pi.

```
apt-get install ansible git
git clone https://github.com/maxlock/packetpi
cd packetpi
ansible-galaxy install -r ./requirements.yml -p roles
