## AX.25 Port configuration

axports:

    # Client port uses the primary callsign without SSID
    callsign: "{{ callsign }}"
    # If a direwolf port is defined, the application will be compiled from
    # source and installed as a service under the given port name.
    direwolf:

        modem: 1200
        kissport: 8010
    # Alternatively, a serial TNC may be used:
    # serialPort: /dev/rfcomm0
    #   or
    # serialPort: /dev/ttyUSB0
    # In either case, the local device will be used by kissattach directly

    # Alternatively, a network TNC may be used:
    # kisshost: 192.168.56.12
    # kissport: 8001
    # In this case, socat is used to create a local serial-like FIFO from
    # a TCP stream -- all kiss semantics are handled by kissattach / ax25

  # Whatever is defined as ax2 will be used for server
  # applications, if any are defined (node, rmsgw, netrom)
