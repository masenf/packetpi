## 
## This playbook uses ALSA loopback device and two instances of
#  direwolf to help test client / server applications over AX.25
#  without radios and TNCs!
#
#  Servers are running on port "dw1" (MYCALL-8)
#    * ax25-node: MYCALL-9
#    * rmsgw: MYCALL-10
#
#  Clients are going out through dw2 (MYCALL)
#
#  After provisioning the vagrant VM with this playbook:
#
#  # XXX: a reboot is currently necessary for AX.25 data to be "seen"
#
#    * Connect to ax25-node from the client
#        `axcall dw2 MYCALL-9`
#    * Connect to pat from the client
#        `sudo -u pat pat --config /etc/pat/config.MYCALL.json connect ax25:///MYCALL-10`
